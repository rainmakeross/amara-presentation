                    <p>Biological immortality is an absence of aging, specifically the absence of a sustained increase in rate of mortality as a function of chronological age.
                        A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal.</p>

                    <h1>Stem Cell</h1>
                    <p> Core Approach: Replace aging/defective cells with new cells </p>
                    <p> Telemerase is an enzyme found in stem cells that allow infinite replication</p>
                    <p> New born cells replicate at an astonishing rate before cells transform from stem stage</p>
                    <p> Organ regeneration, treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Alzheimer's is also possible with this approach</p>

                    <p> Core Approach: Use medical nano robots to repair aging/defective cells/organs </p>
                    <p> Nano robots is a future technology showing promise in rapid production of industrial chemicals and parts</p>
                    <p> An intended research direction is to develop medical nano robots that are designed to conduct repair work on aging cells and organs</p>
                    <p> This approach can also assist in trauma support and ensure enhanced regenerative capabilities over and beyond just repair of aging cells</p>

                    <p> Taking advantage of advances in computer systems and robotics</p>
                    <p> Intention is to develop a semi-permanent or permanent electro-mechanical body to obsolete organic aging</p>

                    <p> Core Approach: Utilize body's energy fields to enhance regeneration </p>
                    <p> Ancient ideas of subtle energy fields in body referred as chakras and meridians</p>

                    <p> Core Approach: Make use of specially prepared mercury containing compounds to repair aging cells </p>
                    <p> Rasayana (Indian alchemy) texts contain 18 step processing of mercury that results in body digestible form that can be utilized for preserving life</p>
                    <p> Life preservation thought to be achieved via preservation of living essence within the body. This approach may be considered an ancient attempt at cybernetics</p>
                    <p> Rasayana quite literally means the science of life preservation</p>
